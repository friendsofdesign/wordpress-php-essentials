# Elements of PHP

PHP as any programming language consists of elements. In conjunction with the correct use of PHP syntax these elements become the core of the system. These elements are similar to the elements of HTML or JavaScript, they make up the pieces needed to successfully write code, like id’s, classes, and tags in HTML, provide the backbone of a website structure and layout.

* **Variable** - Container which allow developers to store data. I.e. `$myVariable`
* **Identifier** - Name assigned to a variable.**\***
* **Expression** - A value, variable, combination of variables, operators \(operands\) and values that produce a result.
* **Operands** - The variables and values contained in the Expression.
* **Operators** - Symbols that denote the manipulation of operands. There are number of different types of operators.
* **Arithmetic Operators** - These perform mathematical operations, addition, subtraction, etc.
* **Assignment Operators** - These perform assignment of values to variables. i.e. `$myVariable = 5;`
* **Comparison Operators** - These are used to compare and evaluate whether a value is greater than another. i.e. `5 > 3`
* **Logical Operators** - Used to compare two or more boolean operands and test for equality. i.e `! == 5` \(not strictly equal to 5\).
* **Special Operators** - Special operators are part of the code syntax and are used to make the code understandable to the browser or PC.
* **Literal** - A fixed value, like a number or string. Sometimes called a "static" value.
* **Events** - A class that represents an event firing on a file which is ready to read from or write to; or read from/write to; a timeout expiring; a signal occurring; a user-triggered event.
* **Method** - A set of code written as an executable procedure defined on an object.
* **Function** - A set of code written as an executable procedure not defined on an object.
* **Function Definition** - The code within the function that make up the procedure of the function.
* **Parameter** - A variable which is declared in a function definition but passed into the function’s parentheses, thus defining the number or data type of objects to be passed into the function when executed.
* **Call** - Ask the server/computer to execute a function or method.
* **Arguments** - Variables and values passed into a function’s parentheses.
* **Variable Scope** - Variables can be defined in two scopes, Global or Local. A global variable can be used in all parts of the code. Local variables can only be used within the function it was declared in.
* **Data Types** - A specific category of data that a variable can hold. Number, Boolean, String, Undefined, and Null.
* **Primitive Types** - Data that can only be assigned a single value.
* **Integer** - Positive or negative numbers with or without decimal places or a number written in using exponential notation
* **Float** - Floating point numbers with a decimal place also known as a double.
* **Boolean** - Logic value for true or false.
* **String** - Alphanumeric numbers and letters i.e. `"This is a string of text"` or `"42"`.
* **Undefined** - A non-existent variable, or has no value or cannot resolve the expression.
* **NULL** - An empty value.
* **Object** - An object is a datatype which stores data and information on how to process that data.
* **Array** - A list of variables, objects or values, always beginning at 0.
* **Resource** - The special resource type is not an actual data type. It is the storing of a reference to functions and resources external to PHP.
* **Statements** - Commands that are used when the app or site code needs to make a decision. There are many statements that can be utilised when asking the system to make decisions based on values or events.
* **If Statement** - This is conditional statement to check if the arguments provided evaluate as true.
* **If Else Statement** - If the conditional statement does not evaluate to true, do something else. This can also be nested in an IF statement.
* **Switch Statement** - Allows a developer to execute a particular set of statements based on value of a specific expression.
* **While Statement** - This is a loop statement, it will repeat a series of statements as long as the conditions of the expression is met.
* **Do While Statement** - This is another loop statement, it will execute a statement or series of statements once, then repeat as long as the condition is met.
* **For Statement** - Also known as "for loop", this is used to repeat a series of statements as long as the conditional expression evaluates to true.
