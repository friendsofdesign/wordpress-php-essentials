# What is a Content Management System?

A content management system \(CMS\) is a computer program that allows publishing, editing and modifying content as well as maintenance from a central interface or admin area. Such systems of content management provide procedures to manage workflow in a collaborative environment.

These procedures can be manual steps oran automated cascade. CMSs have been available since the late 1990s.CMSs are often used to run websites containing blogs, news, and shopping. Many corporate and marketing websites use CMSs. CMSs typically aim to avoid the need for hand coding but may support it for specific elements or entire pages.

More importantly, a web content management system \(web CMS\) is a bundled or stand-alone application to create, manage, store and deploy content on Web pages. Web content includes text and embedded graphics, photos, video, audio, and code \(e.g., for applications\) that displays content or interacts with the user. A web CMS may catalog and index content, select or assemble content at runtime, or deliver content to specific visitors in a requested way, such as other languages. Web CMSs usually allow client control over HTML-based content, files, documents, and web hosting plans based on the system depth and the niche it serves.As you can see from the abobe definitions, CMS’s are there to help us manage content without us having to hard-code client side languages all day long.

## Alternative CMS

Wordpress is a popular CMS for many reasons like we’ve discussed, but that doesnt mean its the only one. Each CMS has its own strengths and weaknesses. One thing developers find incredibly frustrating with Wordpress is its link management, having to constantly add PHP functions to create dynamic links.

Examples of other open-source CMS:

* Drupal \([www.drupal.org](https://github.com/friendsofdesign/wordpress-php-essentials-2017/tree/b1e23ab37f09383d8d5ed520d7827d998ffefbad/www.drupal.org)\)
* Joomla \([www.joomla.org](https://github.com/friendsofdesign/wordpress-php-essentials-2017/tree/b1e23ab37f09383d8d5ed520d7827d998ffefbad/www.joomla.org)\)
* Magento \([www.magento.com](https://github.com/friendsofdesign/wordpress-php-essentials-2017/tree/b1e23ab37f09383d8d5ed520d7827d998ffefbad/www.magento.com)\)

  These sites, save for Magento which is a ecommerce CMS, have been around for a while and many developers still use them. Many of these CMS work on the same principles and concepts that Wordpress does, they’ve just gone about it in a different way, maybe using different languages Ruby instead of PHP for example. There is no better or king CMS out there - it really boils down to how comfortable you are in your skill and what you need to accomplish.
