# A Brief History of PHP

PHP is one of the most widely used and recognizable technologies in use on the internet. Originally PHP stood for "Personal Home Page", though more recently it has been changed to stand for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor". PHP 3.0 was the first version that closely resembles PHP as it exists today. One of the biggest strengths of PHP 3.0 was its strong extensibility features. It provided end users with a mature interface for multiple databases, protocols, and APIs. Extending the language itself was simpler and an ease, thus it attracted even more developers.

PHP 4.0, based on the ZEND engine, and coupled with a wide range of additional new features, was officially released in May 2000, two years after its predecessor. It showed highly improved performance, and included other key features such as support for many more web servers, HTTP sessions, output buffering, more secure ways of handling user input and several new language constructs.

PHP 5 was released in July 2004 after long development and several pre-releases. It is mainly driven by its core, the ZEND Engine 2.0 with a new object model and dozens of other new features.

The most widely supported version of PHP on web servers is PHP 5.6, however PHP 7 has been released on the ZEND Engine 3.0. Until it is more widely supported by hosting companies and web servers it is recommended to use PHP 5.6 syntax and functions. Much of the PHP 7 Syntax is interchangeable with PHP 5.6 and so it will be easy to migrate your projects from 5.6 to 7 at a later stage.
